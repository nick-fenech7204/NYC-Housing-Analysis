# New York City Housing Prices
Our group's capstone project will be focused on investigating NYC housing prices and how different factors may contribute/impact prices. We also want to conduct machine learning to see if we can predict prices in the year following our data (2022). We plan on using NYC Open Data to pull home details as well as an API call to the Census Bureau to combine our NYC housing data with other attributes such as rental/ownership/income/ages/etc. to compare our main data set to supplementary information.

Some Questions we ask ourselves:
"How do home costs change throughout NYC and its boroughs? What attributes impact these prices?”
"Are there any noticeable patterns or trends in the types of properties that are being sold or rented in New York, and what these attributes are?"
“What is the average rental rate compared to mortgage rate for properties in different boroughs in New York, and how does this compare to income?”
“Can we predict the home prices in 2022 using past data?”
