# New York City Housing Prices
Our group's capstone project will be focused on investigating NYC housing prices and how different factors may contribute/impact prices. We also want to use machine learning techniques to see if we can predict prices in the year following our data (2022). We plan on using NYC Open Data to pull home details as well as an API call to the Census Bureau to combine our NYC housing data with other attributes such as rental/ownership/income/ages/etc to compare our main data set to supplementary information.

### Some questions we asked ourselves:
* "How do home costs change throughout NYC and its boroughs? What attributes impact these prices?”
* "Are there any noticeable patterns or trends in the types of properties that are being sold or rented in New York, and what these attributes are?"
* “What is the average rental rate compared to mortgage rate for properties in different boroughs in New York, and how does this compare to income?”
* “Can we predict the home prices in 2022 using past data?”

### Questions:
* How do home costs change throughout NYC and its boroughs? 
* What attributes impact the home prices of the boroughs?
* Are there any noticeable patterns or trends in the types of properties that are being sold or rented in New York? 
* What is the average rental rate compared to mortgage rate for properties in different boroughs in New York? 
* What role does income play in the rental/mortgage rates for properties in different boroughs?
* What is the disparity in home ownership from different age groups?
* Can we predict the home prices in 2022 using past data?”


Which tasks are dependent on other tasks:
* Machine Learning, Power BI, and SQL Database are all reliant on a working Pipeline, once SQL database is normalized, we can delegate tasks, and all of this is dependent on our initial EDA and Cleaning of our data
What order the tasks must be completed in.
* Acquire Data (CSV/API), insert into Blob, Clean Data, manage databricks, create pipeline, use Kafka to create a producer and consumer, create a SQL database, use ML and PowerBI to answer our questions and show meaningful conclusions with our data.
How your team will communicate.
* Our team is communicating through a shared github repo, a shared google docs file, and microsoft teams. 
Planned completion dates for each task.
* May 4th - look at different data sets and start thinking about which one we want to work with
* May 5th - Find a data set and start doing some EDA
* May 8th - Pitch our data set and await approval
* May 9th - Work on an outline of our data set and our initial plans
* May 10 - Work on a project management plan for our data set, work on our pipeline
* May 11 - turn in our project management plan and complete our pipeline
* May 12 - creating a github repo and sending the link
* May 15 - Additional EDA to determine if we can feasibly answer our questions with our dataset
* May 18 - Complete ML on our data sets and answered our questions
* May 19 - Created our visuals through PowerBI and general housekeeping of our project before turning in
